# AI-Powered Elderly Care Assistant: Proposed Solution

## Integrating Local LLMs with IoT for In-Home Monitoring, Companionship and Remote Care

The proposed AI-Powered Elderly Care Assistant represents a comprehensive solution that seamlessly integrates local Large Language Models (LLMs) with Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to address the critical challenges of aging-in-place and remote eldercare. At its core, the system leverages a modular architecture built on FastAPI with specialized blueprints for speech recognition, AI processing, MQTT communication, and emergency management, ensuring scalable and maintainable deployment across diverse home environments. The solution employs OpenAI's Whisper model for high-accuracy speech-to-text conversion, coupled with locally-hosted Ollama LLMs (such as Llama 3.2) to provide privacy-preserving, context-aware conversational assistance that understands eldercare-specific needs and can detect emergency situations through natural language processing. The system's IoT integration utilizes MQTT protocol for real-time communication with smart home devices, enabling voice-controlled environmental adjustments, health monitoring through connected sensors, and automated emergency alerts to designated caregivers and healthcare providers. The React-based frontend, optimized with Vite for performance, provides intuitive interfaces for both elderly users and their caregivers, featuring large, accessible controls, real-time conversation displays with transcription capabilities, and comprehensive dashboards for monitoring health metrics, medication reminders, and social interaction patterns. Emergency detection capabilities are embedded throughout the system, utilizing AI-powered keyword recognition and behavioral pattern analysis to automatically trigger multi-channel alerts via MQTT to family members, caregivers, and emergency services when anomalies or distress signals are detected. The solution's local processing approach ensures data privacy and reduces latency while maintaining 24/7 availability, making it particularly suitable for elderly individuals who value independence but require discrete monitoring and immediate access to assistance. This integrated approach transforms traditional eldercare by providing continuous, intelligent companionship that learns individual preferences and routines while maintaining seamless connectivity to the broader care network, ultimately enabling safer, more dignified aging-in-place with enhanced quality of life and peace of mind for both elderly users and their families.
