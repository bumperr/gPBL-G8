## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ installed
- FastAPI backend server running (see parent directory)

### Installation

1. **Start Development Server**:
   ```bash
   # Windows
   start-dev.bat
   
   # Or manually:
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

2. **Open in Browser**:
   - Visit `http://localhost:3000`
   - The app will auto-open on mobile-friendly view

3. **Setup Your Profile**:

## Building for Production

```bash
# Windows
build-app.bat

# Or manually:
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `build/` folder ready for deployment.

## Configuration

1. **Copy environment file**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Update settings**:
   - `REACT_APP_API_URL` - Your FastAPI backend URL
   - Other settings as needed

## API Integration

The app connects to your FastAPI backend for:

- **Chat/AI**: `/chat` endpoint for AI responses
- **TTS**: `/tts` endpoint for text-to-speech
- **MQTT**: `/mqtt/send` for real-time messaging
- **Health**: `/health` for system status

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, Material-UI 5
- **Audio**: Web Audio API, MediaRecorder
- **Communication**: Axios, MQTT over WebSocket
- **Styling**: CSS3, Material-UI theming
- **Build**: Create React App, Webpack

## Browser Support

- **Recommended**: Chrome, Safari, Edge (latest versions)
- **Mobile**: iOS Safari, Android Chrome
- **Features**: Requires microphone access for voice recording

## Deployment

### Web Server Deployment
1. Run `build-app.bat` to create production build
2. Upload `build/` folder contents to your web server
3. Configure URL rewriting for single-page app:
   
   **Apache (.htaccess)**:
   ```apache
   Options -MultiViews
   RewriteEngine On
   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
   RewriteRule ^ index.html [QR,L]
   ```
   
   **Nginx**:
   ```nginx
   location / {
     try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
   }
   ```

### Mobile App (PWA)
- The app includes a web app manifest for "Add to Home Screen"
- Works offline for basic functionality
- Push notifications can be enabled via service worker

## Security Considerations

- **HTTPS Required**: For microphone access and security
- **CORS**: Configure FastAPI backend to allow your domain
- **Authentication**: Consider adding user authentication for production
- **Data Privacy**: Voice recordings are processed locally when possible

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Microphone not working**:
- Ensure HTTPS (required for microphone access)
- Check browser permissions
- Try refreshing the page

**Can't connect to backend**:
- Check `REACT_APP_API_URL` in `.env`
- Ensure FastAPI server is running
- Check browser console for CORS errors

**App not responsive on mobile**:
- Clear browser cache
- Check mobile browser compatibility
- Try different mobile browser

### Development Tips

- Use browser developer tools mobile simulation
- Test with actual mobile devices
- Check network tab for API call failures
- Use React DevTools for component debugging
